# Internal: Lost/Stolen Card - Cross-Product Security Protocol

When a customer reports a lost or stolen debit card, there is a risk that other cards in their wallet were also compromised. Agents must follow this cross-product security protocol to protect the customer's full relationship with Rho-Bank.

## Required Security Check

When a customer reports a lost or stolen debit card:
1) Complete the standard debit card freeze/close procedure
2) Check if the customer has any Rho-Bank credit cards on file
3) If yes, proactively offer to order a replacement credit card as a security precaution
4) Explain that wallet theft often involves multiple cards and this protects against potential fraud

## How to Check for Credit Cards

Use get_credit_card_accounts_by_user to retrieve any credit card accounts for the customer. This will return all active and closed credit card accounts.

## Offering Credit Card Protection

If the customer has one or more credit cards:
- Inform them that you noticed they also have a credit card with Rho-Bank
- Ask if their credit card was also in the lost/stolen wallet
- Offer to order a replacement credit card with a new card number to prevent any unauthorized charges
- If they decline, note in the account that the offer was made

## Why This Matters

Customers who lose their wallet often focus on their debit card and forget about credit cards until fraudulent charges appear. Proactively offering this protection demonstrates excellent customer service and reduces fraud losses for the bank.

## Agent Script Example

"I see that you also have a [Card Type] credit card with us. Was that card also in your lost wallet? If so, I can order a replacement card with a new card number to protect you from any potential fraud. Would you like me to do that for you?"
