# Internal: Applying Credits to Savings Accounts

This document describes the policy and procedure for agents to apply credits to customer savings accounts. Use the apply_savings_account_credit_6831 tool to add a credit transaction to a savings account.

Eligible Circumstances for Applying Credits:

Agents are authorized to apply credits to savings accounts ONLY in the following circumstances:

1. Interest Corrections: If a customer's interest payment was calculated incorrectly due to a system error (e.g., missing APY boost from linked checking account, incorrect tier rate applied, missing relationship bonus), the agent may apply a credit to correct the discrepancy. Before applying: Verify the customer's account details and APY components using get_all_user_accounts_by_user_id_3847, review transaction history using get_bank_account_transactions_9173 to confirm the interest amount credited, calculate the correct interest amount based on documented APY rates and bonuses, determine the difference between expected and actual interest.

2. Fee Refunds: If a fee was incorrectly charged to the savings account (e.g., excess withdrawal fee charged when customer was within limits, monthly maintenance fee charged when balance requirement was met), the agent may apply a credit to refund the incorrect fee.

3. Goodwill Credits: In exceptional circumstances where a customer has experienced significant inconvenience due to bank error, a goodwill credit may be applied. Goodwill credits should be rare and typically require supervisor approval for amounts over $25.
