# Generating a Credit Card Referral Link (Internal)

## Pre-check before providing the referral tool
- Search the knowledge base to confirm the specific card has a documented referral program.
- Verify the customer’s understanding of referral terms. If the customer cites terms that do not match any documented program, clarify the discrepancy.
- If no referral program is documented for the requested card, or if the user’s claimed terms are incorrect, or if there is reason to believe the referral will be automatically rejected, explain why and do not provide a referral link tool. Do not transfer to a human in these cases.

## How the user generates their referral link
- Provide the customer with this tool and instruct them to run it themselves:
  - `get_referral_link(user_id: str, card_name: str)`
- Tell the customer to pass their own user_id and the exact card name (for example, 'Gold Rewards Card').
- When the tool is called successfully, a referral record is created with status 'NO_PROGRESS'. The referred person can then use the generated link to apply.

## Important reminders
- Weekly limit: Customers can receive at most 2 referral bonuses in any rolling 7-day window; the third and subsequent referrals in that window are automatically denied.
- Agents must not generate the link on the customer’s behalf.
- Reiterate the correct referral terms as documented to prevent confusion and complaints.
