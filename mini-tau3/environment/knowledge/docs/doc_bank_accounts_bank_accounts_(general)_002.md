## Eligibility Requirements (Internal Checklist)

Confirm all of the following before proceeding:
- Customer identity is verified in our systems.
- Customer has at least one active Rho-Bank checking account.
- Customer currently holds fewer than 5 personal savings accounts.
- Customer has no accounts in collections and no negative balances.
- The customer’s checking account tenure is at least 14 days.

Do not proceed if any item above is not met.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1) Verify identity
- Authenticate the customer and confirm identity verification status on file.

2) Check eligibility
- Confirm an active checking account exists and meets the 14-day tenure requirement.
- Count existing personal savings accounts; ensure the customer is below the 5 limit.
- Review account status; there must be no collections activity and no negative balances.

3) Confirm account selection
- Discuss available personal savings account options with the customer.
- Capture the exact account_class string. It must be the full official name ending with “Account” (for example, “Silver Plus Account”, “Gold Account”).

4) Open the savings account (agent action)
- Use the open_bank_account_4821 tool with account_type set to 'savings' and the confirmed account_class.

5) Arrange opening deposit
- Ask the customer if they want you to transfer the opening deposit from their checking account now.
  - If yes: use transfer_funds_between_bank_accounts_7291 to transfer the required amount from the customer’s checking account to the newly opened savings account.
  - If no: inform the customer they have 30 days to fund the account (via internal transfer or external deposit) or the account will be closed.

6) Confirm completion
- Provide the new account details and confirm the funding status or the funding deadline.

## Agent Tool Usage (Internal Only)

The AGENT calls these tools directly to perform actions on behalf of the customer. Do not ask the customer to call tools or provide tool parameters.

- Tool: open_bank_account_4821(user_id, account_type, account_class)
  - When to call: After steps 1–3, once eligibility is confirmed and the customer has selected an account_class.
  - How to set parameters:
    - user_id: the authenticated customer’s user identifier.
    - account_type: 'savings' for personal savings accounts.
    - account_class: the full official account name ending with 'Account' exactly as confirmed with the customer.
  - Expected outcome: Creates a new personal savings account for the customer.

- Tool: transfer_funds_between_bank_accounts_7291(source_account_id, destination_account_id, amount)
  - When to call: In step 5, only if the customer authorizes an immediate transfer for the opening deposit.
  - How to set parameters:
    - source_account_id: the customer's Rho-Bank checking account to be debited.
    - destination_account_id: the newly opened personal savings account to be credited.
    - amount: the required opening deposit amount confirmed with the customer.
  - Expected outcome: Moves funds from checking to savings to complete the opening deposit.

## Decision Points and Handling

- Exceeds savings account limit: If the customer already has 5 personal savings accounts, do not open a new one. Inform the customer they have reached the maximum.
- Insufficient checking tenure: If the checking account has been open fewer than 14 days, advise the customer when they will become eligible.
- Collections or negative balances: Resolve these issues first; do not proceed until all accounts are in good standing.
- Customer defers funding: Clearly communicate the 30-day funding window and the consequence of closure if unfunded. Document the acknowledgment in the interaction notes.
