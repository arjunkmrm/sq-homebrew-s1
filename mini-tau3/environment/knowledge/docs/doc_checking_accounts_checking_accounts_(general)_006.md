# Why does my account have a lower balance than I expected or have a negative balance?

## What can cause a lower or negative balance
- Overdraft protections may temporarily cover transactions, which can display a negative balance until incoming funds post or adjustments complete.
- Authorization holds reduce your available balance while a merchant finalizes a purchase or security deposit.
- Pending card transactions and checks can decrease available funds before they appear as posted.
- Scheduled payments or transfers may be earmarked, lowering your available balance in advance.

## How to review and resolve
- Check both pending and posted activity to understand current holds and recent payments.
- Add funds or transfer money from another account to restore a positive available balance.
- If a hold seems higher than expected, contact the merchant to request a release or adjustment.
- Review and adjust overdraft settings to align with your preferences for coverage and fees.
- If something looks incorrect, contact support with transaction details and timestamps.

## Decline Codes Related to Balance Issues

If your debit card was declined due to balance-related reasons, you may have encountered one of these codes:

### CODE 51 - Insufficient Funds

The account doesn't have enough funds for the transaction. This is the most common decline but requires careful diagnosis.

1. **Check Current Balance**: Look up the customer's accounts to get the checking account balance.

2. **If balance APPEARS sufficient** for the transaction amount:
   
   a. **Check Authorization Holds**: Ask the customer if they have any recent authorization holds that might be reducing their available balance.
      - Authorization holds reduce available balance but don't show as posted transactions.
      - Common sources: gas stations (often $75-$150 pre-auth), hotels, car rentals, restaurants (tip buffer).
      - If holds exist, explain: 'Your posted balance is $[balance], but you may have pending authorization holds reducing your available balance. These holds typically release in 1-3 business days.'

   b. **Check Pending Transactions**: Review recent transaction history and look for transactions with status 'pending'.
      - Pending debits reduce available balance.
      - Explain: 'You have pending transactions totaling $[amount] that haven't posted yet.'

   c. **Check Overdraft Settings**: The account's overdraft_pos_enabled field from the account lookup shows if overdraft is enabled for POS.
      - Regulation E requires customer opt-in for POS/ATM overdraft coverage.
      - If overdraft_pos_enabled is FALSE: 'Your account isn't opted into overdraft coverage for debit card purchases. Would you like me to explain your options?' Then reference the overdraft features documentation.

3. **If balance is genuinely insufficient**:
   - Inform customer of their balance.
   - Offer options: 'Would you like to transfer funds from another account, or would you prefer to make a smaller transaction?'
   - If they want to transfer, help them do so.

### CODE 52 - No Checking Account

The PIN was accepted but the underlying checking account has issues.

1. Look up the customer's accounts to check the account status.

2. If account status is CLOSED: 'The checking account linked to this debit card has been closed. This card can no longer be used for transactions.'
   - If customer wants to continue banking with Rho-Bank, discuss opening a new checking account.

3. If account exists and is OPEN but still getting this code: This may be a system synchronization issue. Advise waiting 10-15 minutes and retrying.
