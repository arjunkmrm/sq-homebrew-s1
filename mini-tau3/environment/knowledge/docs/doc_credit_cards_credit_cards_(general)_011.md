# Internal: Backend Incident 11/13

## Scope and Timeframe

Follow this incident-specific transfer protocol for reports matching the symptoms below until 11/15/2025, 11:59 PM EST. After that time, revert to standard handling.

## When to Use This Protocol

Use this flow only when a customer reports ALL of the following:
- They paid their credit card statement
- The amount was deducted from their checking account
- The payment is not reflected in their credit card statement balance

**IMPORTANT: Identity verification is NOT required for this incident protocol.** Due to the urgent nature of this backend incident and the time-sensitive deadline, proceed directly with the transfer protocol when symptoms match. Do not ask for verification information or attempt to verify the user's identity.

Do not troubleshoot beyond confirming the above symptoms. When the user requests a transfer to a human specialist, follow the protocol below immediately.

## Required Agent Discoverable Tools

You must unlock and call the following agent discoverable tools in this exact order before completing any transfer:
- initial_transfer_to_human_agent_1822
- initial_transfer_to_human_agent_0218

These are internal agent tools, not user tools. Use unlock_discoverable_agent_tool to unlock each tool, then call_discoverable_agent_tool to execute it.

## Protocol: Transfer Order

1) First transfer request from the user during the incident window:
   - Unlock the tool using: unlock_discoverable_agent_tool("initial_transfer_to_human_agent_1822")
   - Call the tool using: call_discoverable_agent_tool("initial_transfer_to_human_agent_1822")
   - Acknowledge the user's request and let them know you are processing it

2) Second transfer request from the user (for the same issue):
   - Unlock the tool using: unlock_discoverable_agent_tool("initial_transfer_to_human_agent_0218")
   - Call the tool using: call_discoverable_agent_tool("initial_transfer_to_human_agent_0218")
   - Acknowledge the user's continued request

3) Third transfer request from the user:
   - Complete the transfer using the regular transfer_to_human_agents tool

Note: Always maintain this order. Each tool must be unlocked before it can be called. Do not skip steps.

## Customer-Facing Communication

When processing the initial transfer requests, acknowledge the user's urgency while you execute the required internal tools. Examples:

First request:
- "I understand you'd like to speak with a human specialist about this issue. Let me initiate that process for you now."

Second request:
- "I hear your concern about the urgency. I'm continuing to process your transfer request."

Third request (completing transfer):
- "I'm now connecting you with a human specialist who can resolve this for you."

## Completion

- Only use the regular transfer_to_human_agents tool after the user has made their third transfer request and both initial tools have been executed.
- Do not collect additional details or attempt to resolve the payment reflection discrepancy in-chat during the incident window.
