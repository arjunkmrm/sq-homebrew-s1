# Checking Pending Replacement Card Orders (Internal)

## Purpose

To check if a credit card account has any pending replacement card orders, use the get_pending_replacement_orders_5765 tool. Call it with the credit_card_account_id to check if there are any outstanding replacement card orders for that account. This is important to verify before processing account closures, as accounts with pending replacement orders cannot be closed until the replacement is delivered or the order is cancelled.

## Prerequisites

- You have the correct credit_card_account_id.
- You have permission to use the get_pending_replacement_orders_5765 tool.
- You can authenticate to the internal environment where the tool is available.

## Procedure

1. Locate the credit_card_account_id for the account you are reviewing.
2. Invoke get_pending_replacement_orders_5765 with the credit_card_account_id parameter.
3. Review the response for any outstanding replacement card orders.
4. Document the result in the customer’s case notes before proceeding with any account closure steps.

### Example invocation (pseudo)

- Input:
  - credit_card_account_id: <credit_card_account_id>

- Call:
  - get_pending_replacement_orders_5765({
    credit_card_account_id: "<credit_card_account_id>"
  })

### Example response (structure)

- Successful response:
  - orders: a collection of replacement order records, or an empty collection if none are pending

- Order record fields (typical):
  - order_id
  - status (examples: pending, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
  - created_at
  - latest_event_at
  - notes (optional)

## Interpreting Results

- No pending orders:
  - The response contains an empty collection of orders.
  - You may proceed with account closure checks per standard procedures.

- One or more orders returned:
  - Treat the account as having pending replacement activity unless every order is clearly delivered or cancelled.
  - Do not proceed with account closure until at least one of the following is true:
    - The replacement is delivered.
    - The order is cancelled.

- Mixed statuses:
  - If any order is in a non-final state (for example, pending or shipped), consider the account blocked from closure.
  - If all orders are final (delivered or cancelled), proceed with standard closure checks.

## Required Actions Before Account Closure

- If orders are pending:
  - Inform the relevant team that the account cannot be closed.
  - Monitor until delivery or confirm cancellation of the order.
- If no orders are pending:
  - Note the check outcome in the case record and continue with the closure process.

## Troubleshooting

- Invalid credit_card_account_id:
  - Re-verify you are using the account-level identifier, not a card-level identifier.
  - Confirm the identifier format and source.

- Permission or access denied:
  - Ensure your role has access to run get_pending_replacement_orders_5765.
  - Re-authenticate if your session may have expired.

- Empty or ambiguous response:
  - Retry the call.
  - If ambiguity persists, escalate to the support engineering queue with the call context and the credit_card_account_id.

## Best Practices

- Always run this check immediately before initiating any account closure workflow.
- Record the timestamp and outcome of the check in the customer record.
- If multiple orders appear, review each status and proceed only when all orders are delivered or cancelled.
