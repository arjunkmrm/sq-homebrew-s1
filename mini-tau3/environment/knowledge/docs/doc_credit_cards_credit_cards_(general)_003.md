# Submitting a Cash Back Dispute (Internal)

## When to use this
Use this process when a customer believes there is a discrepancy between the cash back they received for a particular transaction and the cash back they should have received. This process applies to all credit card transactions.

## How to submit the dispute
Instead of a step-by-step workflow, instruct the customer to use the tool directly:

- Tool to provide to the user: `submit_cash_back_dispute_0589(user_id: str, transaction_id: str)`
- Tell the customer to run the tool with their own user_id and the specific transaction_id for the purchase in question.

## Agent notes
- Confirm the customer has the correct transaction_id before they submit.
- Do not collect sensitive card details; the tool uses the identifiers provided by the user.
- Advise the customer that supporting context (e.g., category or promotion expectations) may be requested later during review, but the submission itself is initiated with the tool above.
