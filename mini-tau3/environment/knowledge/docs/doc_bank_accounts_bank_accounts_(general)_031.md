# Internal: Filing a Debit Card Transaction Dispute

When a customer needs to file a dispute for a debit card transaction (unauthorized charges, ATM errors, merchant issues, or incorrect amounts), the agent must gather comprehensive information and follow Regulation E requirements. Before proceeding, inform the customer of their liability exposure based on when they noticed the unauthorized activity:
- Reported within 2 business days of statement: Maximum liability $50
- Reported within 60 days of statement: Maximum liability $500
- Reported after 60 days: Unlimited liability - customer may not recover funds

Dispute the earliest (first) transaction when multiple duplicates exist.

**Pre-Filing Requirements:**
1. Customer must be verified
2. Transaction must be at least $1.00
3. Transaction must be within 60 days old
4. Customer cannot exceed the maximum open disputes for their checking account tier: Entry Tier max 2, Mid Tier max 3, Premium Tier max 4, Elite Tier max 5. Dispute limits are per account, not per customer.
5. The debit card must be linked to an OPEN checking account
6. For ATM disputes, determine if it was a Rho-Bank ATM or third-party ATM (different processes apply)

**Tool: file_debit_card_transaction_dispute_6281**

**Tool Arguments:**

1. **transaction_id** (string) - ID of the transaction being disputed. Use get_bank_account_transactions_9173 to find it.

2. **account_id** (string) - The checking account ID linked to the debit card.

3. **card_id** (string) - The debit card ID. 

4. **user_id** (string) - The customer's Rho-Bank user ID.

5. **dispute_category** (string) - Must be exactly one of:
   - 'unauthorized_transaction': Transaction customer did not make or authorize (use only when fraud is NOT suspected)
   - 'atm_cash_discrepancy': ATM dispensed wrong amount or no cash
   - 'atm_deposit_not_credited': ATM deposit not reflected in account

   - 'goods_services_not_received': Paid but never received item/service
   - 'recurring_charge_after_cancellation': Subscription cancelled but still charging
   - 'card_present_fraud': Physical card used fraudulently (not by customer) - USE THIS when fraud suspected and card was physically present
   - 'card_not_present_fraud': Online/phone transaction customer didn't make - USE THIS when fraud suspected for online/phone transactions

 When a transaction is unauthorized, determine if fraud is suspected. If YES, use 'card_present_fraud' (for in-store/physical transactions) or 'card_not_present_fraud' (for online/phone transactions). Only use 'unauthorized_transaction' when fraud is NOT suspected (e.g., family member used card without permission, customer forgot about a transaction, etc.).

6. **transaction_date** (string, MM/DD/YYYY) - Date the disputed transaction occurred.

7. **discovery_date** (string, MM/DD/YYYY) - Date customer first noticed the issue.

8. **disputed_amount** (float) - The dollar amount being disputed.

9. **transaction_type** (string) - Determine from user circumstances. Must be exactly one of:
   - 'pin_purchase': In-store purchase with PIN
   - 'signature_purchase': In-store purchase with signature
   - 'online_purchase': Online or card-not-present transaction
   - 'atm_withdrawal': ATM cash withdrawal
   - 'atm_deposit': ATM deposit
   - 'recurring_payment': Subscription or automatic payment
   - 'person_to_person': P2P transfer (EveryonePay, etc.)

10. **card_in_possession** (boolean) - Ask: "Do you still have your physical debit card in your possession?" This affects fraud classification.

11. **pin_compromised** (string) - Ask: "Do you believe your PIN may have been compromised?" Must be exactly one of:
    - 'yes_shared': Customer shared PIN with someone
    - 'yes_observed': Customer believes PIN was observed/skimmed
    - 'no': PIN not compromised
    - 'unknown': Customer unsure

12. **contacted_merchant** (boolean) - Ask: "Have you attempted to resolve this directly with the merchant?" Required for non-fraud disputes.

13. **police_report_filed** (boolean) - For fraud disputes over $500, ask if customer has filed a police report. If not, recommend they do so.

14. **written_statement_provided** (boolean) - Whether the customer has provided a written statement describing what happened. Required for Reg E provisional credit eligibility. Ask the customer: "Are you willing to provide a written statement describing what happened? We can use this conversation as your written statement if you agree." Set to true if the customer agrees.

15. **provisional_credit_eligible** (boolean) - Agent must determine based on Debit Card Provisional Credit Guidelines.

16. **card_action** (string) - Determine based on dispute category using the mapping below. Must be exactly one of:
    - 'keep_active': Keep card active
    - 'freeze_pending_investigation': Temporarily freeze card during investigation
    - 'close_and_reissue': Close card and issue replacement

**Note:** This parameter records metadata only; the agent must separately perform the indicated card action after filing the dispute.

**Card Action Mapping by Dispute Category:**
- 'card_present_fraud' → 'close_and_reissue'
- 'card_not_present_fraud' → 'close_and_reissue'
- 'unauthorized_transaction' → 'freeze_pending_investigation'
- 'atm_cash_discrepancy' → 'keep_active'
- 'atm_deposit_not_credited' → 'keep_active'
- 'duplicate_charge' → 'keep_active'
- 'incorrect_amount' → 'keep_active'
- 'goods_services_not_received' → 'keep_active'
- 'recurring_charge_after_cancellation' → 'keep_active'

**Multiple Disputes on Same Card:** When filing multiple disputes for the same card, record each dispute's card_action based on its own category mapping (do NOT change individual dispute parameters). However, when performing the actual card action after filing all disputes, use the MOST SEVERE action across all disputes. Severity order (highest to lowest): 'close_and_reissue' > 'freeze_pending_investigation' > 'keep_active'. For example, if Dispute A maps to 'keep_active' and Dispute B maps to 'freeze_pending_investigation', record 'keep_active' for Dispute A and 'freeze_pending_investigation' for Dispute B, but then call freeze_debit_card_3892 (the most severe action) once for the card.
