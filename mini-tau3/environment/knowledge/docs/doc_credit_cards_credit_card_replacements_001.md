# How to Order a Replacement Credit Card (Internal)

## Before you order
- Verify the customer's identity using standard verification procedures.
- Look up the customer's credit card account.
- Confirm the shipping address with the customer (primary or alternate, including any unit or suite information).
- Ask for the replacement reason and record exactly one of: fraud_suspected, lost, stolen, damaged, expired, or other.
- Ask whether they want expedited shipping (advise on possible fees by tier; see Shipping selection).
- Confirm eligibility for replacement in the knowledge base before proceeding. Do not unlock or call the tool unless the customer is eligible. If not eligible, explain next steps per the knowledge base.

## Shipping selection
- Standard delivery: 7–10 business days; no fee.
- Expedited shipping: 2–3 business days; fees by tier:
  - Entry-tier (Bronze Rewards, EcoCard, Business Bronze): $15.00.
  - Mid-tier (Silver Rewards, Business Silver, Green Rewards, Silver Zoom): $10.00.
  - Premium-tier and above (Gold, Platinum, Diamond Elite): $0.00 (complimentary).
- If the reason is fraud_suspected or stolen, strongly recommend expedited shipping to minimize exposure and remind the customer to review recent transactions for unauthorized activity.

## Tool workflow
- Unlock the tool:
  - Use unlock_discoverable_agent_tool with tool_name: order_replacement_credit_card_7291.
- Call the tool:
  - Use call_discoverable_agent_tool with tool_name: order_replacement_credit_card_7291 and include:
    - Customer credit card account identifier (e.g., account_id or card_id from the account lookup).
    - Reason: fraud_suspected, lost, stolen, damaged, expired, or other.
    - Shipping_address: the confirmed address.
    - Shipping_speed: standard or expedited.
    - Expedited_fee_acknowledgement: customer consent captured if a fee applies based on tier.
    - Notes: any relevant context (e.g., travel dates, fraud report reference, delivery instructions).

## After you submit the order
- The old card is automatically cancelled for security and will no longer work for new purchases.
- Communicate the expected delivery window based on the selected method (standard: 7–10 business days; expedited: 2–3 business days).
- Advise the customer to watch for email notifications when the order is placed and when the card ships.
- If the reason was fraud_suspected or stolen, remind the customer to review recent transactions and dispute any unauthorized charges in the app or website.
- Document the interaction and the replacement order details in the customer record.
