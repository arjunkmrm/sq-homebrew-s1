# Checking User Dispute History (Internal)

## Summary

To retrieve a user's credit card dispute history, use the get_user_dispute_history_7291 tool. Call it with the user's user_id to get a list of all disputes filed by that user, including dispute dates, statuses, and transaction details.

## When to Use

- You need a consolidated list of all credit card disputes filed by a specific user.
- You are reviewing the current status or historical progression of a user’s disputes.
- You need transaction-level context for each dispute.

## Required Input

- user_id (required): The user’s canonical internal identifier.

Tip: Ensure you are using the correct and current user_id before making the call.

## Procedure

1. Obtain the user_id for the user whose dispute history you need to review.
2. Invoke the tool with the user_id parameter.
3. Review the returned list of disputes and associated transaction details.

Example invocation (pseudocode):
```
result = get_user_dispute_history_7291(user_id="<user_id>")
```

## Expected Output

- A list of dispute records for the specified user.
- Each record includes:
  - Dispute identifiers and metadata:
    - dispute_id
    - dispute_date
    - status (for example: open, under_review, closed)
    - last_updated_at
  - Transaction details related to the dispute:
    - transaction_id
    - transaction_date
    - merchant_name
    - amount
    - currency
    - card_last4
  - Additional dispute context (if available):
    - reason_code
    - outcome
    - notes or internal comments

Example response shape (illustrative):
```
[
  {
    "dispute_id": "<dispute_id>",
    "dispute_date": "<timestamp>",
    "status": "<status>",
    "last_updated_at": "<timestamp>",
    "transaction": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "transaction_date": "<timestamp>",
      "merchant_name": "<merchant>",
      "amount": "<amount>",
      "currency": "<currency>",
      "card_last4": "<last4>"
    },
    "reason_code": "<reason>",
    "outcome": "<outcome>",
    "notes": "<internal_notes>"
  }
]
```

## Interpreting Results

- Verify the list is complete for the user_id you queried.
- Use dispute_date and last_updated_at to understand timeline and recency.
- Use status to determine whether action is needed.
- Review transaction details to confirm the disputed transaction context.

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

- Empty result set:
  - The user has not filed any credit card disputes, or the user_id is incorrect.
  - Confirm you are using the correct user_id and try again.
- Permission or access error:
  - Ensure you have the necessary internal privileges to view dispute histories.
- Invalid or malformed user_id:
  - Validate the format of user_id and reissue the request.
- Partial or truncated data:
  - Retry the call.
  - If the issue persists, capture the request context and escalate through internal support channels.

## Operational Notes

- This tool returns only credit card disputes associated with the specified user_id.
- Always handle user data in accordance with internal data handling and privacy requirements.
