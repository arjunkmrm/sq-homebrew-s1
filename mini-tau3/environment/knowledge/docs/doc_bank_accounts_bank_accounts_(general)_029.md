# Internal: Debit Card Replacement Options by Account Tier

When a customer requests a replacement debit card (due to lost, stolen, damaged, or other reasons), the replacement policies vary based on the customer's checking account tier.

IMPORTANT - Fee Charging: All applicable fees (shipping, design, excess replacement) are AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED to the linked checking account when the card is ordered. Always inform the customer that the fee will be deducted from their checking account balance before placing the order. When using order_debit_card_5739, you must provide the exact delivery_fee and design_fee amounts based on the tier rules below.

How to Check Replacement History:
1) Retrieve all cards for the account
2) Look for cards with issue_reason of 'lost', 'stolen', 'fraud', or 'damaged'
3) Check the date_issued field and count cards issued within the last 12 months
4) Cards with issue_reason of 'new_account', 'first_card', 'expired', 'upgrade', or 'bank_reissue' do NOT count toward the replacement limit.
