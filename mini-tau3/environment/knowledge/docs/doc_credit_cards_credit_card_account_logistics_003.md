# Internal: Credit Card Retention Protocol

## Step 1: Verify Closure Eligibility

Before attempting retention, confirm the customer is eligible to close their account. Check these in order:

1. Pending disputes: The account must not have any active or pending transaction disputes. If present, advise the customer to wait for resolution before closing.
2. No pending replacement cards: If a replacement has been ordered and not yet received or activated, a closure cannot proceed.
3. Minimum account age: The account must be open for at least 60 days. If not, inform the customer they cannot close yet.
4. Outstanding balance: The account must have no outstanding balance. If a balance remains, the customer must pay it off before closure.

If any requirement is not met, explain what must be resolved and do not proceed with retention offers.

## Step 2: Check for Previous Retention Attempts (Abuse Prevention)

Use the get_closure_reason_history_8293 tool to determine whether this specific credit card account has any closure reason records within the past year. If records exist for this account within that time frame, skip retention offers and proceed directly to processing the closure.

Tool arguments for get_closure_reason_history_8293:
- credit_card_account_id (string, required): The credit card account ID the customer wants to close.

If records are found within the past year, inform the customer you will proceed with their closure request and move to Step 6.

## Step 3: Understand and Log the Reason

Ask the customer why they want to close their account. Then log it using log_credit_card_closure_reason_4521.

Tool arguments for log_credit_card_closure_reason_4521:
- credit_card_account_id (string, required): The credit card account ID the customer wants to close.
- user_id (string, required): The customer's unique identifier in the system.
- closure_reason (string, required): One of: 'annual_fee', 'not_using_card', 'found_better_card', 'unhappy_with_rewards', 'simplifying_finances', 'negative_experience', 'other'.

Note: Only these three arguments are accepted. Do not add additional parameters.

## Step 4: Address the Concern

Offer tailored solutions based on the customer's reason:

- Annual fee concerns: If they have been a customer for 2+ years, offer to waive their annual fee for one year as a loyalty benefit. Use apply_credit_card_account_flag_6147 (see tool arguments below). If they have been a customer for less than 2 years, offer a permanent downgrade to a no-annual-fee card while preserving account history.

Tool arguments for apply_credit_card_account_flag_6147 (Annual Fee Waiver):
- credit_card_account_id (string, required): The credit card account ID to apply the waiver to.
- user_id (string, required): The customer's unique identifier.
- flag_type (string, required): Use 'annual_fee_waived'.
- expiration_date (string, required): Set to a date a year from today in MM/DD/YYYY format.
- reason (string, required): Use 'loyalty_benefit' for long-tenured customers.

- Not using the card: Remind them of benefits they may be missing and suggest setting up a recurring subscription to keep the card active.
- Found a better card: Ask what features attracted them. If Rho-Bank offers a card with similar or better benefits, offer to help them apply instead of closing the current account.
- Unhappy with rewards: Check enrollment in available bonus categories and suggest ways to maximize rewards based on spending patterns.
- Negative experience: Apologize and gather details. Escalate to a supervisor if warranted. Consider offering a modest goodwill credit for service-related complaints.

Step 5: Make a Retention Offer**

If the customer still wants to close after addressing their concerns, make one retention offer based on their card tier:

- Entry-tier cards: Offer 500 bonus points or a $5 statement credit
- Mid-tier cards: Offer 2,000 bonus points or a $20 statement credit
- Premium and above: Offer 5,000 bonus points or a $50 statement credit

## Step 6: Accept the Decision

If the customer declines the retention offer (or was ineligible due to prior attempts), thank them for being a Rho-Bank customer and proceed with closure. Do not apply pressure.

## Important Reminders When Closure Proceeds

- Inform the customer they have 45 days after submitting the closure request to redeem unredeemed rewards; after that, rewards are forfeited.
- If the annual fee posted recently, advise that a full refund may be available if the closure occurs within 37 days of the fee being charged.
